### What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello 👋👋👋

Thanks to fronendmentor team, this challenge gave me an opportunity to learn more about accessibility when building custom component and it is fun!

🚀 **Built with**

- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- ARIA APG Guides

🐲 **What i have done**

- Used my own judgement to achieve **pixel-perfect** without design files
- Built an range slider utilized native `<input type="range">` with custom **draggable** thumb for visual users and accessibility for screen readers (tested with NVDA)
- Overridden default focus effect with outline on button, input

🐦 **Things to improve**

- My JS source code is messy, i am thinking about using TypeScript next time when i came back for this challenge again
- I need a better way to handle CSS `font` custom variables accross all components
